# Computational-Physics-and-Machine-Learning-Reading-List

A list of papers relating Computational Physics and Machine Learning. This list is by no means complete so if there are other resources that you feel are missing either send me a link to loliverhennigh101@gmail.com or do a pull request. I will try to add to this list as much as possible.
